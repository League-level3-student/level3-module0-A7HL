 * Task
 * Given a field of cows find which one is the Wrong-Way Cow and return her
 * position.
 * 
 * Notes:
 * 
 * There are always at least 3 cows in a herd
 * There is only 1 Wrong-Way Cow!
 * Fields are rectangular
 * The cow position is zero-based [col,row] of her head (i.e. the letter c)
 * Examples
 * Ex1
 * 
 * cow.cow.cow.cow.cow
 * cow.cow.cow.cow.cow
 * cow.woc.cow.cow.cow
 * cow.cow.cow.cow.cow
 * Answer: [6,2]
 * 
 * Ex2
 * 
 * c..........
 * o...c......
 * w...o.c....
 * ....w.o....
 * ......w.cow
 * Answer: [8,4]
 * 
 * Notes
 * The test cases will NOT test any situations where there are "imaginary" cows,
 * so your solution does not need to worry about such things!
 * 
 * To explain - Yes, I recognize that there are certain configurations where an
 * "imaginary" cow may appear that in fact is just made of three other "real" cows.
 * 
 * In the following field you can see there are 4 real cows (3 are facing south and
 * 1 is facing north). There are also 2 imaginary cows (facing east and west).
